Manipulators are becoming ubiquitous from industries to commercial applications. As such these robots are either manually operated or autonomous in highly restricted and well-defined environments and are extremely susceptible to changes in the environment - due to human intervention or any other external factor. This study focuses on developing a strategy for the robot to achieve a complex task. The synthesized strategy generates controllers for the robot in reaction to human interventions that cause changes in the environment . This
strategy also accounts for the resource constraints of the robot such as time and energy. Using methods derived from formal methods and games we can then define quantitative safety-critical guarantees with optimal strategies.
